My Name is Michael Davitt. I am a graduate of the UCD Bachelor of Science degree in Actuarial and Financial Studies, currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Conversion), with the aim of acquiring a job in tech/finance. I have 1 year of experience working in the insurance industry, where I was involved in actuarial auditing.
